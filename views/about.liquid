          <p>
            Hi, I'm a Frontend Design & Development student at the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences (HvA). I'm passionate about turning ideas into beautiful, interactive web experiences using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and GSAP.
          </p>

          <p>
            What I enjoy most is bringing websites to life with animation. Motion adds emotion, and that's what makes the web exciting to me. GSAP is my favorite tool so far — it's where creativity meets code.
          </p>

          <p>
            I'm a creative soul who finds inspiration everywhere — in design, in daily life, in books, and while traveling. I'm curious by nature and always eager to explore and learn new things.
          </p>

          <p>
            As a beginner, I believe growth comes from trying, failing, creating, and learning — one project at a time.
